# C1
# The simple way is to calculate each g(i=2 â†’ n).
# To calculate g(i), we iterate p, calculate q = 2i - p, check for primes.
# Time complexity is O(n^2 * root(n))

# C2
# We see that instead of calculating g(i) in the above way, we only need to check which pair p, q
# belongs to g(i). This happens because a pair p, q belongs to exactly one g(i).
# So we only need to count the number of pairs p, q such that p + q <= 2n.
# It is easy to see that we can list the primes < n for easy calculation.
# The sieve can be used for enumeration. After the enum is complete, use 2 pointers to calculate the number of
# possible p, q pairs. Time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is also O(n) due to using sieve.


# we can drop sieve for enumeration if we use quick prime number checking algorithms or something.
# The complexity is O(nk) with k depending on the algorithm used (k <= root n)
